###Keys
Remember that prospective users are frustrated with their current way of doing things. Convince them that by investing time (and money) in your product and they will be in a better place.

The best onboarding experiences:

* Are easy
* Frame the conversation in regards to __user benefits__ rather than __software features__
* Closely align with getting people from A to B in their lives. 
* Allow users to reach the 'aha!' moment of understanding your product __before__ they sign up (not once they start using it)

How to do this?

* Make adoption easy
* Align yourself and your product with user success
* Answer questions before they are asked
* Don't assume any level of familiarity with the product


###Metrics
Identify what people are trying to accomplish when signing up for your product, and develop a method to track the users __on their terms__ along the way.

Good times to interact with the perspective user include:

* When they have not yet used the product within a few days of sign-up
* When the full onboard / usage workflow has stopped before completion. Stuck / need help?
* After successfully completing the workflow. Great time for a high-five and provide next steps.
* Nearing the end of the trial period but haven't finished the workflow. How can you convert them?

You know your onboarding process is working not when more new users sign up, but when more users start coming back to use it.


###Value Proposition
Present your value propisition on the landing page.

It should:

* Be clear, emotive, and achievable
* Written in plain English
* Speak to the __outcome__ of using the product, not the __operation__ of the product  (__Benefits__ NOT __Features__)



###Expositional Copy
Here is your chance to let the viewer know how your product can help. This should also be on the landing page.

Answer the question:

* "What do I gain from using this product?"

Examples:

> "Create stunning newsletters and landing pages in minutes"
> "Buffer shares your content at the best possible times throughout the day so that your followers and fans see your updates more often"
> "Design presentation has never been easier or faster"
> "Discuss creative decisions and feedback in the context of design"



###Visual Guidelines
* Make each screen's primary purpose clear
	* Start Your Free Trial!
* Consistent button styles improve scanability
* Placing relevant videos (showcase / tutorials) front and center on the landing page draws attention and starts educating and exposing the potential user to your app immediately
	* Also provide links to these types of resources contextually during the on boarding process!
* Handling administrative setup tasks modally over the actual obscured interface can introduce users to the look and feel before they need to use it.
* Friendly faces / people can draw users in and provide reassurance
* Aspirational background images can increase motivation for using the product
* But...watch out for visual niceties that distract from purpose and CTA



###Flow
The goal is to build momentum and motivation to complete the workflow (and start using the product successfully)

Onboarding flows should:

* Be simple
* Guide curious viewers to becoming users
* Build-up momentum and motivation to complete early
* Lead to actionable places WITHOUT distraction
* Eliminate / minimize roadblocks and momentum killers
	* Is the email confirmation link to create an account really necessary in the middle of the process?
* Minimize the number of progress slowing questions. 
	* Maybe providing a name for the task doesn't need to block getting into the task
* First steps should be trivial / easy, but not meaningless.
* Save challenging steps for last!


Other notes:

* A visual representation of the flow (timeline) can:
	* Help set expectations for the user
	* Show you care about making things easy
	* Eliminate ambiguity as to what steps are necessary to get started
* In-flow education keeps a user engaged and minimizes potential future frustration
	* "Your project has been saved". Before continuing, take a moment to review our rules"....
* Success states at the end of workflows provide reassurance
	* A great opportunity to provide a personal / human touch to strengthen the relationship
* When relevant, provide a clear path to upgrade / convert [*(but not before that time)](#making-the-ask)



###Call to Action (CTA)
To reduce friction of use and adoption, the primary CTA should:

* Be clearly showcased
	* Utilize color, scale, whitespace padding, placement, etc.
	* __High contrast__ aids in user scanning
* Have no visual competition
* NOT be ambiguous as to what or where 
	* "Continue" vs "Billing Information"
* Utilize copy to speak directly to benefit
	* "Start a project" vs "Sign Up"
* But...make sure CTAs don't distract from each other



###Landing Page
The landing page should:

* Provide an easy visualization of the product fitting into my life
* Present the high-level benefit to using the product
* Concisely state how this is achieved
* Provide a personable__benefits-oriented__ call to action
	* "Start converting your visitors into customers today!"
* Don't forget the rules of good [Copy](#copy)

Consider stating things like:

* [ROI](#return-on-investment)
* [Social Proof](#social-proof)



###Return on Investment
* In the simplest terms, how does the user benefit from using this product?
	* Can it be expressed in terms of time or money savings?
	* Or does it truly represent some feature / action not found elsewhere?
	* Does this need to be customized across environments or roles? 

Example:

* Most users save an average of $2000 a month in personnel costs!



###Social Proof
Reassures potential users about the inevitable success of using the product. Having a list of known users / clients / awards / integrations:

* Adds credibility to your brand / product
* ...Which lowers the perceived risk and barrier to adoption

Mind the "four horseman" of trust:

* Face
* Logo
* Name
* Blurb

Examples:

* There are currently xxxxx people using ____ who have executed xxxx
* "97% of customers recommend ______. Find out why"
* "Last week, xxxx companies signed up for _____ to _____. Today it's your turn"



###Navigation
* Striped down navigation helps people quickly dive into action
* Supplementary navigation should be just that: out of the way


###Help / Training
* When possible, use the app to train users on the app
--preload app with content that demonstrates usage



###Pricing
* Simple, distraction free, and digestible
* Easy to tell what I pay now and possibly also what I would pay as my usage goes up


###Making the 'Ask'
* When offering a free trial, avoid asking for an upgrade right away for new users.
	* Don't ask a new user for an upgrade on first sign-in, before using app
* Consider placing the ask in relation to a point within the onboarding process.
* Users are likely not ready to sign-up after reading only the tagline.


###Copy
* Personable, motivating copy can nudge users
	* "Start your free, no risk, 30 day trial. No credit card, no surprises, just results!"
* Empathetic pep talk copy can encourage users to continue
	* "Thank you
* "Free" & "No credit card required" reduces friction of use
* Repeat head/tag line from landing page to other parts of the experience
* Be engaging and emotive
	* "It's lonely in here" (when no contacts are in the app)
* Successfully pairing scannable copy with interesting imagery can make for a wholly engaging experience
* Provide reassurance as to what fields if any are public / private
	* "Don't worry, no one will see this"
* Emotionally anchoring content and actions can be powerful 
* When dealing with ancillary content, ask yourself if users will actually read it.
	* Is it better to sprinkle in as a change of pace throughout the rest of the site?


###Personalization
* Personalize emails to guide user along the onboarding journey
	* Welcome and Thank You
	* Encouragement to use
	* Need help getting started?
	* Success!
* If having a persona is important, consider integrating with services like [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) to personalize the experience without requiring anything from the user
	* Similarly, possibly offer one-click registration / sign-up using the existing social networks
* When applicable, customize UX and content to user (browser/OS/location sniffing)


###Social Sign-In
* Potential user likely already has an account setup with a social provider
* Eliminates one step in the onboarding process
* Added benefit of possibly exposing your product to the network of the user


###User Interactions
* __Minimize__ common points of __frustration__
	* Show password requirements before-hand!
* Avoid situations where a user can't tell if something worked
	* Use spinners, messaging, etc
* Feedback and positive confirmation is key after any user action
* Emotionally anchoring interactions with good copy is powerful
* Prepare users for 3rd party UX
	* You can't control experience, but you can support and guide along the way
* Personal information is sacred (email, phone, financial)
	* Use personable, "talk-down" copy to frame the ask
	* Examples:
		* "Fill out one little field, we won't do bad stuff with it"
		* "Don't worry, we're not going to call you in the middle of the night"
* One-click social sign-in makes sign-up easy 
	* If you use that, reset password link would be great
